These results are extracted from multiple crawls, as opposed to the results in 2023, which we extracted from 1 sample crawl. 
The results of 2023 were not generalizable to crawls from different times, i.e. 2014 vs 2022. 

Here the results are also calculated for 1st, 2nd, 5th, 7th, 10th, 20th, ..., 80th, 90th, 93rd, 95th, 98th, 99th percentiles.

About en:
